# TrainQuery Static Data

Stores the transit system configuration and static timetables used by [TrainQuery](https://github.com/schel-d/trainquery).

**Note:** The static timetables provided in this repository are currently completely ignored. TrainQuery pulls its timetable information from the Department of Transport and Planning's [GTFS data feed](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/timetable-and-geographic-information-gtfs).

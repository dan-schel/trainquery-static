# About TrainQuery

TrainQuery is an unofficial guide to help you navigate Melbourne's train network. You can search for any suburban or regional train station to view upcoming departures, and adjust the departure time or filter to further refine the results.

## Can you trust this site?

{ERROR}**Not really.**{/ERROR}

At the moment, this site is powered purely by static timetables made available by [Metro Trains Melbourne](https://www.metrotrains.com.au/timetables) and [V/Line](https://www.vline.com.au/Timetables/Additional-pages/train-coach-timetable-list) which I have to enter manually...ish. So as soon as there's any disruption to the regular timetable â€” planned or unplanned â€” chances are this site won't reflect that.

PTV [does actually publish](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/data-and-reporting/datasets/ptv-timetable-api/) an API of live timetable data, so I do intend to make use of that in the future to enhance the quality and timeliness of what gets shown here, but I've made a conscious choice to prioritise loading the static timetables first because the quality of data you get from the PTV API leaves a lot to be desired at times.

## Lol, then why bother?

Well it's all just a bit of fun. I'm a uni student exercising my web dev skills! Besides, if you just want to check the timetables with the above caveats in mind, then this site is a great way to do that ðŸ˜‰.

Thanks for checking it out!

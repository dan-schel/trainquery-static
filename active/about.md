# About TrainQuery

TrainQuery is an unofficial guide to help you navigate Melbourne's train network. You can search for any suburban or regional train station to view upcoming departures, and adjust the departure time or filter to further refine the results.

## Can you trust this site?

**Well... somewhat.**

At the moment, this site pulls its timetables from the Department of Transport's [GTFS data feed](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/timetable-and-geographic-information-gtfs), however I'm still working on integrating the [realtime feed](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/gtfsr-metro-trains-vehicle-positions). That means you'll see the services correctly as scheduled, but the site won't react to unplanned disruptions or have live departure times just yet.

Besides that, in future I also plan to use the [PTV API](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/data-and-reporting/datasets/ptv-timetable-api/) to make disruption messages available on the site, as well as to enhance the quality of what gets shown here by providing a "second opinion". Hopefully I'll have that finished soon!

## Hmm ok, why bother lol?

Well it's all just a bit of fun. I'm a uni student exercising my web dev skills! Besides, if you just want to check the timetables keeping all that in mind, then this site is a great way to do that ðŸ˜‰.

Thanks for checking it out!
